//! The [`CaseSet`] API below is a safe and simplified version of the `case_set*` macros in `ctx.h`.
//!
//! The `case_set*` macros themselves replaced `memset`s in order to further optimize them
//! (in e3b5d4d044506f9e0e95e79b3de42fd94386cc61,
//! which performed the following optimizations:
//! 1. larger, inlinable writes for small power of 2 lengths
//! 2. aligned writes for the above
//! 3. 8-byte aligned fields [`BlockContext`]
//!   * allows 8-byte aligned writes
//!   * better cache boundary alignment
//!
//! (1) is easy to preserve in Rust, but (2) is difficult to do so without overhead,
//! as unaligned writes are UB, and so we'd need to check at runtime if they're aligned
//! (a runtime-determined `off`set is used, so we can't reasonably ensure this at compile-time).
//!
//! To more thoroughly check this, I ran the same benchmarks done in
//! e3b5d4d044506f9e0e95e79b3de42fd94386cc61, which introduced the `case_set*` macros:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo build --release && hyperfine './target/release/dav1d -i ./tests/large/chimera_8b_1080p.ivf -l 1000 -o /dev/null'
//! ```
//!
//! for 3 implementations:
//! 1. the original `case_set*` macros translated directly to `unsafe` Rust `fn`s
//! 2. the safe [`CaseSet`] implementation below using [`small_memset`] with its small powers of 2 optimization
//! 3. a safe [`CaseSet`] implementation using [`slice::fill`]/`memset` only
//!
//! The [`small_memset`] version was ~1.27% faster than the `case_set*` one,
//! and ~3.26% faster than the `memset` one.
//! The `case_set*` macros were also faster than `memset` in C by a similar margin,
//! meaning the `memset` option is the slowest in both C and Rust,
//! and since it was replaced with `case_set*` in C, we shouldn't use it in Rust.
//! Thus, the [`small_memset`] implementation seems optimal, as it:
//! * is the fastest of the Rust implementations
//! * is completely safe
//! * employs the same small powers of 2 optimization the `case_set*` implementation did
//! * is far simpler than the `case_set*` implementation, consisting of a `match` and array writes
//!
